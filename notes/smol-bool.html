    <h1>Smol bool</h1><p>A good blog post is Boolean Blindness:<br><a href="https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/03/15/boolean-blindness/">Boolean Blindness on Robert Harperâ€™s blog.</a></p><p>I run into this kind of thing pretty frequently:</p><blockquote><p>The problem is computing the bit in the first place.  Having done so, you have blinded yourself by reducing the information you have at hand to a bit, and then trying to recover that information later by remembering the provenance of that bit.</p></blockquote><h2>Enterprise Software Engineering</h2><h3>Bad error messages and validation errors in particular</h3><br>
