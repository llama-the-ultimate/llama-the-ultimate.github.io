      <h1>I struggle and am frustrated and nothing is resolved</h1><p>We rewatched Adaptation the other day:</p><blockquote>What if a writer is attempting to create a story where nothing much happens, where people don't change, they don’t have any epiphanies. They struggle and are frustrated and nothing is resolved.</blockquote><p>Sometimes people give you advice on what you should do if you’re giving a talk at a conference or writing a blog post or something. Stuff about what those things should contain and maybe how you should prepare and so on. The people giving advice are often channeling fictionalized Robert McKee.</p>
