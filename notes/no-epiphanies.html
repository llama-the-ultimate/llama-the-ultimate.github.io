    <h1>Nothing is resolved</h1><p>From Adaptation:</p><blockquote>Sir, what if a writer is attempting to create a story where nothing much happens, where people don't change, they don't have any epiphanies. They struggle and are frustrated and nothing is resolved.</blockquote><p>I donâ€™t know sometimes I think that something along those lines should maybe be a disclaimer for most of the posts here.</p>
