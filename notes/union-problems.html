    <h1>Smaller things are smaller</h1><p>Sometimes there’s something like:</p><p>Person one has problem 𝐀 and person two has solved the similar problem 𝐁. And maybe person two extends their solution so that it solves 𝐀∪𝐁 and person one can reuse it. The solution can keep growing like that.</p><p>And in many cases, person one learning a little about the solution to 𝐁 could possibly be like, enough. If 𝐁 is simpler than 𝐀∪𝐁 it might be easier to learn from the 𝐁-solution. Taking inspiration from it when solving 𝐀 could lead to two simpler solutions instead of one more complex.</p><h2>Somewhat related Chuck Moore thing</h2><blockquote>Do It Yourself!</blockquote><blockquote>The conventional approach, enforced to a greater or lesser extent, is that you shall use a standard subroutine.
