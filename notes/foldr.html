      <h1>Something, foldr, sugar</h1><p>I dunno. Does taking away some sugar and infixity make some things more clear?</p><p>Some Standard ML:</p><pre>- nonfix +;
nonfix +
- + (1, 2);
val it = 3 : int
- nonfix ::;
nonfix ::
- :: (1, :: (2, :: (3, nil)));
val it = [1,2,3] : int list
- foldr + 0 (:: (1, :: (2, :: (3, nil))));
val it = 6 : int
</pre><p>(We removed the infix thing from + and :: (the plus function and the list “cons”). They take tupled arguments. Infix 1 + 2 is nonfix + (1, 2), and so on.)</p><p>Here, I guess we can say that</p><pre>foldr + 0 (:: (1, :: (2, :: (3, nil))))
</pre><p>is kind of equivalent to</p><pre>+ (1, + (2, + (3, 0))).
</pre><p>And it is maybe more clear how</p><pre>+ (1, + (2, + (3, 0)))
</pre><p>is similar to the list</p><pre>0 (:: (1, :: (2, :: (3, nil)))
</pre><p>It is like the list we but with the list constructors, :: and nil, replaced with + and 0 (the first two values we gave to foldr).</p><p>Also maybe unsurprising that</p><pre>foldr :: nil (:: (1, :: (2, :: (3, nil))))
</pre><p>will be equivalent to</p><pre>:: (1, :: (2, :: (3, nil)))
</pre><p>and evaluate to a list that looks like the one we started with?</p><hr><p>(At least, more clear than when saying that<br>foldr (op +) 0 [1, 2, 3]<br>is equivalent to<br>1 + (2 + (3 + 0))?)</p><hr><p>And also like maybe not I dunno.</p>
