      <h1>Types of functions</h1><p>Blah. So functions are fun and for me they are often a useful way to think about programs.</p><p>And then, for me, types more or less come with the territory. A function applied to an argument can be evaluated to a result value. When I think about a function, I tend to think about things like:</p><ul><li>What do arguments I can apply this to look like?</li><li>Which expressions are likely to evaluate to things I can use as arguments?</li><li>What will results I get from applying the function look like?</li><li>Where can I use such results?</li></ul><p>And that is like, type stuff, far as I can tell.</p><p>(Which is not to say that the thinking is necessarily in terms of a type <em>system</em>, or that any of this has a thing to do with type <em>checking</em>, or anything. Just, types, okay yes.)</p>
