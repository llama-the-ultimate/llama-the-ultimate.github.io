      <h1>Gemtext</h1><p>I ran into Gemini the other day.</p><p><a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/">Project Gemini</a></p><p>It’s a protocol for internet that has a lot of “simplicity” and implementability in it. It kind of comes with its own markup language for text content:</p><p><a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/gemtext.gmi">Gemtext</a></p><p>A few interesting-to-me things:</p><ul><li>It is line-oriented: Line type can be determined by looking at the first three character. Depending on the line type it might take an “argument,” like the URL for a link. And then the rest of the line is just plaintext.</li><li>It is line-oriented: You can’t do formatting like emphasizing a bit of text within a line. It’s mostly just the “line type” stuff at the beginning of the line that you have to care about when parsing.</li><li>It is line-oriented: A paragraph is a long line. You don’t need to, and shouldn’t, add newline characters at every 80 characters or something like that.</li><li>It is line-oriented: You can’t really nest stuff. E.g. there’s a line type for list item and there’s a line type for blockquote. A list item and a blockquote must be different lines. You can’t have list items within a blockquote. And so on.</li></ul><p>It’s pretty easy to make a parser for it.</p><p>It’s very easy to write. Some things I like:</p><ul><li>Compared to something like Markdown, or at least what Markdown typically looks like, it looks more like the plaintext notes I tend to write. Long lines (word wrap in editor rather than newlines within paragraphs). Little text formatting stuff. Links on their own lines.</li><li>A link being an entire line kind of reminds me that it is good to have reasonably self-contained link text that doesn’t depend too much on the surrounding text. Which I think is sometimes appreciated by people using screen readers.</li><li>Same as with something like Markdown, but unlike regular web-stuff, any “styling” is done client-side.</li></ul><p>A couple of things I’m not sure if I like:</p><ul><li>I’m not sure if I’m missing the text formatting stuff.</li><li>I sometimes do stuff like nested lists in my plaintext notes. Probably not a big deal.</li></ul><p>Anyway a thing I think I like is that it actually makes trade-offs. Not the “well everything’s a trade-off” thing that people say when they don’t want to deal with something, but more like, there are some clearly valuable things that it doesn’t do, just (I think) because it values simplicity more. Something like that.</p><p>It is so common to see not very useful things added for very little reason. I think I admire the restraint.</p>
