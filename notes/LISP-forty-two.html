      <h1>Solving a number problem using idiomatic LISP</h1><p>Hi okay one time I ran into a number problem that went something like this: “How many (natural) numbers less than or equal to one million are there whose digits add up to forty-two?”</p><p>Okay let’s solve this using Racket. Racket is a maybe a LISP. In LISP, pretty much the only thing that matters is you have to use parentheses.</p><blockquote>Parentheses essentially are the basis of computation.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OubXOd0Twl4">―Robert Constable, 8 minutes or so into this OPLSS 2015 lecture</a></p><p>Anyway we can stare at this problem for a while and then notice three things.</p><ul><li>One thing is that the digits in one million do not add up to forty-two.</li><li>Another thing is that the numbers less than one million all have six digits (or they might as well have, and can be padded with leading zeroes).</li><li>Anothother thing is that forty-two divided by six equals seven.</li></ul><p>So. We only need to care about numbers that have six digits, and if every digit is seven they add up to forty-two. More, if the digits in a number are “balanced around seven” they also add up to forty-two. (A six can be made up for by an eight, a three by two nines, and so on.)</p><p>Okay so that’s extremely good to know. We pretty much just wanna balance stuff. And parentheses are like incredibly good things to balance.</p><hr><p>Racket comes with a read-procedure. read reads an expression from something, and it makes sure parentheses are balanced. Problem solved, then, more or less...</p><pre>#lang racket
</pre><p>We need some halp. <code>read-string</code> will <code>read</code> a string until its end. If any parentheses are out of balance, read will throw and the <code>with-handlers-bit</code> will catch and make it so that we return the number zero. Otherwise one.</p><pre>(define (read-string s)
  (with-handlers
      ([(λ (_) #t) (λ (_) 0)])
    (define in (open-input-string s))
    (let loop ()
      (unless (eof-object? (read in))
        (loop)))
    1))
</pre><p>Woop woop. We can use <code>read-string</code> to kind of check if a string has balanced parentheses. If we can turn numbers into strings, so that a string only has balanced parentheses in it if the digits in the number add up to forty-two, then stuff.</p><p><code>number-&gt;chars</code> will turn a number into a list of characters, maybe padded with some zeroes:</p><pre>(define (number-&gt;chars n)
  (string-&gt;list (~a n
                    #:min-width 6
                    #:pad-string &quot;0&quot;)))
</pre><p>Now we can have one character for every digit in a number. We make a <code>char-&gt;string</code>-function that will turn a character like that into a string. The string will have parentheses that are just as much balanced as the digit was balanced around seven:</p><pre>(define (char-&gt;string c)
  (match c
    [#\0 &quot;(((((((&quot;]
    [#\1 &quot;((((((&quot;]
    [#\2 &quot;(((((&quot;]
    [#\3 &quot;((((&quot;]
    [#\4 &quot;(((&quot;]
    [#\5 &quot;((&quot;]
    [#\6 &quot;(&quot;]
    [#\8 &quot;)&quot;]
    [#\9 &quot;))&quot;]
    [_ &quot;horses&quot;]))
</pre><p>So, in order to turn a number into a good string, we use <code>number-&gt;chars</code>, then <code>char-&gt;string</code> each digit-character. And then adjust as necessary: We will sort the characters in the string so that any left parentheses come before any right parentheses. <code>number-&gt;string</code> does:</p><pre>(define (number-&gt;string n)
  (define char-list
    (map char-&gt;string (number-&gt;chars n)))

  (list-&gt;string
   (sort (append* (map string-&gt;list char-list))
         char&lt;?)))
</pre><p>Now all that remains is to pick the numbers we care about, then feed to <code>read-string</code> the strings we get by applying <code>number-&gt;string</code>. <code>read-string</code> should return one if things are balanced and zero if not, so if we add together all those zeroes and ones we’re good.</p><pre>(for/sum ([n (in-range 1000000)])
  (read-string (number-&gt;string n)))
</pre><p>You can get the full program at blah. Put it into your DrRacket, press F5 or so, and voi—some 20 seconds wait—là, you will have an answer.</p>
