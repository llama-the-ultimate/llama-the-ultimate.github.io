    <h1>Dark, unless light</h1><p>After looking into dark mode stuff, I have this in my CSS:</p><figure><pre><code>:root {
  color-scheme: light dark;
}
</code></pre><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Which should “opt the entire page into the user's color scheme preferences.”<br><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color-scheme">color-scheme - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN</a></p><p>It’s nice to support dark mode stuff, but it’s particularly nice that if I throw that in everything just works <em>except the parts where I have tried too hard to make things look good</em>.</p><p>After putting that in and turning on dark mode in the browser, I couldn’t see the text in the editor I use for writing Glorpdown. The text was now white and I had at some point decided to use like a slightly darker white than default as background colour for that <code>textarea</code>. So white text on white-but-not-exactly-as-white-as-the-other-white background. Of course, even in light mode, the background colour I had chosen made little difference and didn’t actually look better than the default or anything. It was just a case of me “adjusting things” and then thinking I was a genius because I had done <em>something</em>.</p><p>Anyway it’s nice that dark mode broke it because then I had to choose to either pick a colour to use for dark mode or just remove the <code>background-color</code> part. In my head it went from “picking a colour” to “what I’m in the business of maintaining multiple colour schemes now?” and that made it really easy to choose to remove stuff. Which is often a good choice.</p><p>(It also broke the CodeMirror stuff I use in the lambda calculus posts. Worked around that with some JavaScript that makes it change theme when the user changes their preference for light/dark. But yeah, the CodeMirror thing is probably also a case of having tried too hard to make things look good. Would be nice to just use <code>textarea</code>s for that too. I haven’t found an obvious and obviously supported and recommended way to programmatically insert text in a <code>textarea</code> that plays nice with its undo history. That’s probably all that’s stopping me.)</p>
