TBH the subset of JavaScript that I’m using is fine and has pretty okay ergonomics. Garbage collection, somewhat functional functions and not too cumbersome data structure stuff is convenient.</p><p>Being able to distribute something small that can be run on fairly arbitrary machines without a lot of setting up. I don’t think tens or hundreds of megabytes of runtime is worth it for the stuff I’m typically building. I don’t usually want to build large things or solve complex problems.</p><p>Simple “build toolchain.” I like pressing F5 in DrRacket. I like editing a .js-file, saving it and pressing F5 in my browser. I’m okay with running a more buildy and compily thing that maybe produces a file, particularly if the result is very easily distributable.</p><p>I ran into Kartik Agaram’s Freewheeling a month or two ago:</p><p><a href="http://akkartik.name/freewheeling">Using computers more freely and safely</a><br><a href="http://akkartik.name/post/roundup22">A year of freewheeling apps</a><br><a href="http://akkartik.name/lines.html">Plain text.

It would be nice to have like subset-of-a-browser as a smol VM.</p><p><a href="https://bellard.org/quickjs/">QuickJS</a><br><a href="https://duktape.org/">Duktape</a><br><a href="https://mujs.com/">MuJS</a></p><p>My impression is that QuickJS is more popular than the others, but I’m not sure (and I don’t know if that implies anything I care about).</p><p><a href="https://github.com/endojs/Jessie">Jessie</a></p><p>Jessie doesn’t seem to be particularly implemented or anything.</p><p>I would be interested in something like an implementation of only a subset of JavaScript, maybe something along the lines of Jessie.</p><p>APEs are cool.<br><a href="https://justine.lol/ape.html">Actually Portable Executable</a><br><a href="https://redbean.dev/">redbean</a><br>Also I think QuickJS exists as an APE somewhere...</p><h2>Blog status</h2><p>I’m considering more self-containedness. Should I just chuck all the css into the html file? Also the JavaScript? The more JSy posts have the JS within <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>-stuff in the HTML anyway, so the only code I’d need to add is the bit that finds and executes the rest of the code. Maybe self-contained version as separate version of page, but multiple files by default. So just a “server thing” that decides between refering to files vs inlining the content. Would have to do some work on and around “require” ot make it work.</p><p>The lines stuff takes care of the svg files.</p><p>I’m not sure about the other graphics, like the sokoban graphics. Maybe an upcoming custom pixels format-and-editor. And/or data url stuff?</p><p>I need to get rid of CodeMirror. A textarea would almost do (and I’m using that for the JS), but programmatically inserting text breaks undo history. Should look for a small textarea-with-better-undo-support implementation.</p><p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13597007/how-can-i-undo-the-programmatic-insertion-of-text-into-a-textarea">textarea stuff on SO</a><br><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44471699/how-to-make-undo-work-in-an-html-textarea-after-setting-the-value">more SO textarea stuff</a><br><a href="https://github.com/antonmedv/codejar">codejar github</a><br><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/codejar">codejar npm</a></p><p>codejar (or parts of it) seems a little promising.</p></body>
