TBH he subset of JavaScript that I’m using is fine and has pretty okay ergonomics. Garbage collection, somewhat functional functions and not too cumbersome data structure stuff is convenient.</p><p>Being able to distribute something small that can be run on fairly arbitrary machines without a lot of setting up. I don’t think tens or hundreds of megabytes of runtime is worth it for the stuff I’m typically building. I don’t usually want to build large things or solve complex problems.</p><p>Simple “build toolchain.” I like pressing F5 in DrRacket. I like editing a .js-file, saving it and pressing F5 in my browser. I’m okay with running a more buildy and compily thing that maybe produces a file, particularly if the result is very easily distributable.</p><p>I ran into Kartik Agaram’s Freewheeling a month or two ago:</p><p><a href="http://akkartik.name/freewheeling">Using computers more freely and safely</a><br><a href="http://akkartik.name/post/roundup22">A year of freewheeling apps</a><br><a href="http://akkartik.name/lines.html">Plain text.
