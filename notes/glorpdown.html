      <h1>The dawn of glorp</h1><p>I think Einar said that if you want to blog you should write blog posts, not write blog engine. At least sometimes people say something like that.</p><ul class="links"><li><a href="https://einarwh.wordpress.com/">Einar uses WordPress.</a></li><li><a href="https://einarwh.wordpress.com/2011/05/12/the-indispensable-idisposable/">So when Einar writes about weird DSL for writing HTML it is typically <em>not</em> a description of how his blog works.</a></li></ul><p>Anyway it’s a thing that makes sense. So here’s a new home-made markup language for my home-made blog engine.</p><p>I’ve played around with making my own language for this a few times. I like the idea of having something where it’s so easy to implement tooling for it that, if I ever need or want to reimplement it, maybe in a different language/environment, then that won’t be a big deal. Preferably not even much of a factor in deciding if I’m going to move to a different language or something. And also simple enough so that I can write (and read) posts in that format correctly without much help from specialized tools or something.</p><p>I tend to mess up and things tend to get too complicated.</p><h2>Gemtext</h2><p><a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/gemtext.gmi">Gemtext</a></p><p>I ran into Gemtext the other day. Gemtext takes a pretty straightforward approach to some things.</p><blockquote>You get one kind of list and you can't nest them</blockquote><p>Which goes for most things. Like generally you can’t have &lt;thing&gt; within &lt;other thing&gt;. No quote within a list, or link within a heading, or whatever. Or, it’s very line-oriented, and you can’t like, nest lines.</p><p>It’s not too hard to build a Gemtext-parser. It’s also really easy to write Gemtext in any text editor.</p><p>Also it tends to look kind of like my plaintext-notes would look anyway. E.g. I tend to end up with stuff like paragraphs being long lines and use separate lines for links.</p><p>(Also also I like how using a full line for a link tricks me into writing more self-contained link texts (instead of stuff like the link text being “here”). Which I’m told people using screen readers sometimes appreciate.)</p><h2>Glorpdown</h2><p>So I decided to steal ideas from Gemtext and make something with a lot less functionality than what I have attempted previously:</p><ul class="links"><li><a href="./../glorpdown.html">A Glorpdown editor.</a></li><li><a href="./../gd/notes/glorpdown.txt">This post in Glorpdown.</a></li></ul><p>Some basics:</p><ul><li>A line usually goes like &lt;start&gt;&lt;arguments&gt;&lt;text&gt;. The line type (typically determined by the &lt;start&gt; of the line) decides how many (whitespace-separated) arguments there are. E.g. a link (starts with <code>=&gt;</code>) has two arguments, link type and path. A blockquote has no arguments, just a <code>&gt;</code>-start followed by the text that goes in the quote.</li><li>Within the &lt;text&gt; you can format text: Text between <code>_</code>-characters is <em>emphasized</em>. Text between <code>`</code>-characters is <code>code</code>. You can’t nest/combine those things.</li><li>Within the &lt;text&gt; you can escape a character with a <code>\</code>-character. Necessary for escaping formatting characters or for having regular text lines start with the &lt;start&gt; of another line type.</li></ul><p>Most of the things:</p><h3>Regular text/paragraphs</h3><p>More or less like in Gemtext. The &lt;start&gt; of a regular text line is the empty string. Or: If the start of a line does not match the &lt;start&gt; of any of the other line types, it is a regular text. Should be empty lines between paragraphs. Line breaks within paragraphs are preserved when translating to HTML and such.</p><h3>Headings</h3><p>Same as in Gemtext, three levels: Lines that start with <code>#</code>, <code>##</code> or <code>###</code>. E.g. I do this for the following heading:</p><pre>### Blockquotes
</pre><h3>Blockquotes</h3><p>Same as in Gemtext: Lines that start with <code>&gt;</code></p><pre>&gt; Hello.
</pre><blockquote>Hello.</blockquote><h3>Lists</h3><p>Same as in Gemtext: Lines that start with <code>*</code> are list items.</p><pre>* Item one
* Item two
</pre><ul><li>Item one</li><li>Item two</li></ul><h3>Linky bits</h3><p>Regular links are similar to the ones in Gemtext, but with a “type” argument before the path/url:</p><pre>=&gt; url https://placekitten.com/ Kittens
</pre><p><a href="https://placekitten.com/">Kittens</a></p><p>Unlike in Gemtext there’s a different line type for stuff that should be included in, or viewed in context of, the document. Typically images:</p><pre>&lt;= img https://placekitten.com/200/300
</pre><p><img src="https://placekitten.com/200/300" alt=""></p><p>(In my mind the way this makes sense is that the <code>=&gt;</code>-arrow points to some thing that you can go to, while the <code>&lt;=</code>-arrow is more like, the thing is moving into the current document.)</p><h3>Preformatted text</h3><p>Same as in Gemtext, preformatted text is turned on by a line that starts with <code>```</code>. Not like in Gemtext, any non-whitespace characters directly after the <code>```</code> are considered part of the &lt;start&gt; and must be matched by the start of a later line to turn it off again (so you can e.g. do four backticks for the &lt;start&gt; if you want to have a line of preformatted text start with three backticks without that being a “turn off the preformatted text”-line). No line types or text formatting or escaping characters within preformatted text.</p><p>So:</p><pre>````
code here
```
not turned off yet so things are still code
````
</pre><p>Becomes:</p><pre>code here
```
not turned off yet so things are still code
</pre><p>Like in Gemtext you can write some stuff after the &lt;start&gt; of a line that turns preformatted text <em>on</em> and have that be “alt text,” which is sometimes used for stuff.</p><h3>Key-value pairs</h3><p>Not at all in Gemtext. Mostly for metadata. Lines that start with <code>:</code> are key-value lines. If a line goes <code>:&lt;argument&gt; &lt;text&gt;</code> then &lt;argument&gt; is the key and &lt;text&gt; is the value. E.g. this post has a line that goes:</p><pre>:date 2022-12-06
</pre><p>And then I have some blogging machinery that uses that date for displaying list of posts with their dates.</p><h3>Horizontal rule/thematic change</h3><p>Not in Gemtext. Lines that start with <code>----</code></p><pre>----
</pre><hr><p>Blah blah. That’s mostly it.</p>
