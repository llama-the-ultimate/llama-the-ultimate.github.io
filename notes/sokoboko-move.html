</code></pre></figure></details><h2>Some vectors</h2><p>We want to move the cat. We can make a function that returns its position, so that we know where to move it from. (Cats tend to move from where they are.)</p><figure><pre class="repl"><code>const playerPosition = () =&gt; {
  for ([y, row] of level.entries()) {
    for ([x, square] of row.entries()) {
      if (square === &quot;@&quot; || square === &quot;+&quot;) {
        return vector(x, y);
      }
    }
  }
};

console.log(playerPosition());
</code></pre></figure><p><a href="http://www.sokobano.de/wiki/index.php?title=Level_format#Solution">A Sokoban solution is like a string where each character corresponds to one move made.</a></p><p>We will make vectors for the directions the cat can move in, and a plus-function that we can use for adding a direction to a position. We’ll use the (lowercase) letters that are used in Sokoban solutions as property names.</p><figure><pre class="repl"><code>const directions = {
  u: vector(0, -1),
  d: vector(0, 1),
  l: vector(-1, 0),
  r: vector(1, 0),  
};

const plus = (a, b) =&gt; vector(a.x + b.x, a.y + b.y);

console.log(plus(playerPosition(), directions.l));
</code></pre></figure><p>Should be the position of the square to the left of the cat.</p><h2>Stupid is fun</h2><p>Okay the array with the arrays with the characters is not a <em>great</em> way to model things, but I like using the symbols from the level format. Like this is fun:</p><figure><pre class="repl"><code>console.log(level.map(x =&gt; x.join(&quot;&quot;)).join(&quot;\n&quot;));
</code></pre></figure><p>But it <em>is</em> awkward having more than one symbol for one thing (it’s the player if it’s a <code>@</code> <em>or</em> a <code>+</code>, and so on). Something that takes different “collision layers” or something into account probably makes it easier to implement some things.</p><p><a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/">PuzzleScript is cool btw.</a></p><p>Also, instead of one move being a functional update of the game state or something like that, we’ll just mutate the arrays. I dunno I just think the side-effecty way to do the movement is somehow neat. And it’s fun to kind of recklessly mutate state and then trust that we can implement undo-functionality in order to restore the state we destroyed :)</p><h2>Moving one thing</h2><figure><pre class="repl"><code>const levelGet = (position) =&gt; level[position.y][position.x];
const levelSet = (position, value) =&gt; level[position.y][position.x] = value;

const player = [&quot;@&quot;, &quot;+&quot;];
const box = [&quot;$&quot;, &quot;*&quot;];
const floor = [&quot; &quot;, &quot;.&quot;];

const move = (thing, from, direction) =&gt; {
  const fromIdx = thing.indexOf(levelGet(from));
  if (fromIdx &lt; 0) {
    return false;
  }
  const to = plus(from, direction);
  const toIdx = floor.indexOf(levelGet(to));
  if (toIdx &lt; 0) {
    return false;
  }
  levelSet(from, floor[fromIdx]);
  levelSet(to, thing[toIdx]);
  return true;
};

console.log(move(box, vector(3, 1), directions.l));
console.log(move(player, playerPosition(), directions.l));
console.log(move(player, playerPosition(), directions.l));
console.log(move(player, playerPosition(), directions.l));
drawLevel();
</code></pre></figure><p>So I think is at least mildly stupid-clever, what with the arrays and the indexes, but kind of fun. We use <code>indexOf</code> to check if the <code>from</code>-square is the expected <code>thing</code> (player or box), and to check that the <code>to</code>-square is floor. <code>indexOf</code> also finds out if a square has a goal on it:</p><ul><li>If <code>fromIdx</code> is <code>0</code> the <code>to</code>-square has the expected <code>thing</code> and its on empty floor.</li><li>If it is <code>1</code> the square has the expected <code>thing</code> on a goal square.</li><li>If it is less than <code>0</code> the expected <code>thing</code> is not on the square and we can’t make the move.</li></ul><p>Same with <code>toIdx</code> but for floor: <code>0</code> is empty floor, <code>1</code> is goal square with nothing on it. Less than <code>0</code> means it’s blocked (wall or a floor/goal square with something on it).</p><p>And then we use those indexes to choose the correct characters for the two squares when making the moves. If the <code>to</code>-square was a goal square then we choose the “on goal” character from <code>thing</code>, and so on.</p><h2>Pushing a box</h2><p>Anyway: We attempted to move things four times. First the box near the top one move to the left. Then the player to the left, three times. The last player-move didn’t go through since the <code>to</code>-square was blocked by the box. When moving the player we want to attempt to move any box on the <code>to</code>-square first, in the same direction. Then we can add the move to the move list by checking which moves went through:</p><ul><li>If the player didn’t move, no move was made.</li><li>If the player moved and a box was moved we add the direction letter in uppercase.</li><li>If the player moved and no box was moved we add the direction letter in lowercase.</li><li>It can’t be the case that a box was moved and the player did not move. If a box was moved that must have made room for the player to make its move too.</li></ul><figure><pre class="repl"><code>
const movePlayer = (directionLetter) =&gt; () =&gt; {
  const direction = directions[directionLetter];
  const position = playerPosition();
  const movedBox = move(box, plus(position, direction), direction);
  const movedPlayer = move(player, position, direction);
  if (!movedPlayer) {
    return false;
  }
  moveList += movedBox ? directionLetter.toUpperCase() : directionLetter;
  return true;
};

console.log(movePlayer(&quot;l&quot;)());
console.log(movePlayer(&quot;d&quot;)());
console.log(movePlayer(&quot;l&quot;)());
console.log(movePlayer(&quot;l&quot;)());
drawLevel();
</code></pre></figure><p>The movelist says <code>LDl</code>: We pushed a box to the left, then pushed a box down, then moved to the left. (Then tried to move to the left again. But wall.)</p><h2>Controls</h2><p>That’s pretty much it for movement. If we make so we can push some buttons to call the <code>movePlayer</code> function things will be pretty gamelike:</p><figure><pre class="repl"><code>const commands = new Map([
  [&quot;w&quot;, movePlayer(&quot;u&quot;)],
  [&quot;a&quot;, movePlayer(&quot;l&quot;)],
  [&quot;s&quot;, movePlayer(&quot;d&quot;)],
  [&quot;d&quot;, movePlayer(&quot;r&quot;)]
]);

const doCommand = (key) =&gt; {
  if (commands.has(key)) {
    commands.get(key)();
    drawLevel();
  }
};
canvas.tabIndex = 0;
canvas.onkeydown = event =&gt; doCommand(event.key.toLowerCase());

const button = (key) =&gt; {
  const element= outElement.appendChild(document.createElement(&quot;button&quot;));
  element.innerText = key;
  element.style.fontSize = &quot;2rem&quot;;
  element.style.width = &quot;3rem&quot;;
  element.onclick = () =&gt; doCommand(key);
};

const space = outElement.appendChild(document.createElement(&quot;div&quot;));
space.style.float = &quot;left&quot;;
space.style.height = &quot;1px&quot;;
space.style.width = &quot;3rem&quot;;
button(&quot;w&quot;);
outElement.appendChild(document.createElement(&quot;br&quot;));
&quot;asd&quot;.split(&quot;&quot;).forEach(button);
</code></pre></figure><p>The <code>tabIndex</code> thing makes it so that the canvas can have focus and send <code>keydown</code> events. So you should be able to click the level and then move the cat with wasd. Also buttons. Maybe you can click on them if you don’t have a keyboard.</p><p>Can restart with <code>setLevel</code>:</p><figure><pre class="repl"><code>setLevel(level1);
</code></pre></figure><p>Okay that’s it for now. Boop.</p></body>
