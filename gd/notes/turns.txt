# Taking turns

Some notes on some games and genres and game design issues that sometimes occupies my mind...

## A classical education

Growing up, I played a lot of HoMM3 (Heroes of Might and Magic III) and the first couple of AoW (Age of Wonders) games. Lots of hotseat multiplayer, mostly co-op against not very competent AI players. When you play TBS (turn-based strategy) you tend to think that you’re very intelligent and that “it’s like chess,” but to be honest I think it was mostly “herp derp I like orcs and elves” and being able to play the games together with someone. (We usually had access to one mostly-offline machine, so entire genres were out of the question for multiplayer.)

And also: I like asynchronous multiplayer. Async multiplayer goes by some different names, like “play by (e)mail” or “correspondence.” Anyway it’s nice to have a game going and being able to like check in on the game and maybe play a turn every now and then.

TBS is kind of obviously a good fit for async. Correspondence chess is a popular thing, PBeM was a thing at least in AoW, stuff like that. But there’s a couple of things in HoMM and AoW that does not go that well with async:

* HoMM and AoW are (mostly) IGOUGO (“I go, you go”) games. You play your turn, and when you’re done you wait for the other players, one after another, to play theirs. And you can have a lot of players in them. The more players in a game, the more you have to wait between your turns. It doesn't “scale,” kind of. (There are some “simultaneous turns” options in some of the games, but typically only for synchronous multiplayer.)
* You sometimes play during the other players’ turns. You have kind of a regular strategy, but when there’s a battle it kind of zooms in on that and becomes kind of a tactics game for a bit. During the battle the players involved take turns. Typically you can choose between playing the battles like that and auto-resolving them. When playing AoW PBeM all battles between human players are auto-resolved.

I think the tactical battles add a lot of fluff and atmosphere to the games and makes you feel more attached to your units and things like that. But yeah, not happening in async.

## WEGO

An alternative to IGOUGO is WEGO (“we go”). Typically it goes like this: All the players play their turn at the same time, by making and “submitting” their moves. And then the result of all the moves made by all the players is calculated. And so on. It’s sometimes called “phase-based,” I think because for every turn there’s a decision-phase and a execution-phase.

Translating a IGOUGO game to a WEGO game seems like not straightforward. Many actions become less predictable in WEGO. E.g. moving into the position occupied by an enemy unit in order to attack it is straightforward in IGOUGO. In WEGO it could be a mess of “missing” units you’re trying to attack or players accidentally attacking each other without meaning to. Predicting enemy movement and accounting for that can be interesting in its own way, but it’s still like, different, and if things get too chaotic and no one’s able to make meaningful decisions then welp.

Anyway, I think some unpredictability is fine and can be fun. Like throwing a dice every now and then. It can get out of hand, just.

I played Frozen Synapse a little when it was new. It’s a WEGO tactics game with small squads of people shooting guns at each other and that. It was fun but I’m not convinced the skill ceiling was very high. Or, it seemed to me there wasn’t that much more you could do than “something unpredictable that performs well against predictable enemy behaviour.” It seemed more or less impossible to account for everything that could happen during a turn. It was too chaotic, too many different things could happen. You could usually make sure that _if_ the enemy did the obvious thing then you’d win, and that otherwise it’d be a coin flip.

Laser Squad Nemesis is maybe somewhat the same category, but that game seemed pretty dead by the time I heard about it. I’m not sure if it feels the same way re predictability. (I’m under the impression that it might be a little less chaotic because larger maps and longer fights and stuff, but not sure.)

A fair amount of wargames do WEGO. I might have played some of them a little bit but I can’t really recall.

I _think_ Solium Infernum is WEGO too. I never played the 2009 version. There’s a remake coming.

### Dominions

The Dominions games are WEGO. I have played a couple of the games, but not a lot. They’re closer to the fantasy TBS games of my childhood than the other WEGO games mentioned here:
* Lots of fantasy stuff.
* Games can have many players.
* Battles that remind me of the tactical battles of those other games. The battles are auto-resolved, but you can watch them and lots of detailed stuff happens in them. Also, you can position units and set some behaviour for them in preparation for battles, which somewhat makes up for not being in control of them when the battle is happening.

My impression is that it’s a somewhat popular multiplayer game in certain circles because of the async-friendly WEGO, the support for many players, and the fantasy stuff.

The strategy feels a bit grander than in AoW or HoMM. Instead of tilemaps it has more Risk-like maps with “provinces” and units don’t move that much around during turns. I think there’s more menu-work and less small-scale manoeuvring.

## Other stuff

Ogre Battle. Real-time, almost automatic battles. I more or less haven’t played it. The speed of the real-time stuff seems like something that would maybe work as “real-time with pause”-esque WEGO. The battles have some of the some stuff going for them as Dominions, with positioning units and that. Less detailed, more JRPG-like maybe.

Warlords. I’ve played a little of it but not a lot. IGOUGO with automatic battles. You get to put group different armies into stacks, and choosing the “fight order” within a stack (at least in some of the games). So less detailed than both Dominions and Ogre Battle I guess. There tends to be more stacks on the map than heroes in the map in HoMM, so maybe the “strategic” part is a bit more tactical. The regular view of the world is called the tactical map or playing map. while the minimap is called the strategic map. So yeah. Anyway I wonder how much “tactics” you get out of the fight order stuff.

Hero’s Hour. Haven’t played. HoMM-like, but with real-time mostly automatic battles. The battles could maybe be turned into fully automatic ones. The battles look like fun. Lots of chaos and stuff happening.

Barony. IGOUGO board-game. Map of hexes, pretty simple and elegant rules. You don’t move very far during a turn, but the moves are very significant. Battles are very simple (if there are two knights from one player on a hex, they kill any enemy knights and settlements there). It ends up being more about threatening and guarding than actually fighting. (A thought re WEGO: If “the threat is stronger than the execution” does that make the WEGO-unreliability less important? I suspect maybe not and that a thing is less threatening if it cannot be reliably executed. The “guarding” thing might be more relevant though.) Other thing to note: It’s a bit chess-like in that you choose one action per turn. So if you’re busy moving some units to defend over there, you can’t recruit units over here during the same turn. (Avoiding or getting into situations where you’re stuck responding to threats instead of progressing seems to me like it’s maybe not _that_ reliant on the IGOUGO.)
