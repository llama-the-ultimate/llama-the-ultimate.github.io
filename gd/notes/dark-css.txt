# Dark, unless light
:blurb henlo ol frien

After looking into dark mode stuff, I have this in my CSS:
```
:root {
  color-scheme: light dark;
}
```
Which should “opt the entire page into the user's color scheme preferences.”

It’s nice to support dark mode stuff and I that bit of copypasting probably means I’m pretty talented. But it’s particularly nice that if I throw that in everything just works _except the parts where I have tried too hard to make things look good_.

After putting that in and turning on dark mode in the browser, I couldn’t see the text in the editor I use for writing Glorpdown. The text was now white and I had at some point decided to use like a slightly darker white than default as background colour for that `textarea`. So white text on white-but-not-exactly-as-white-as-the-other-white background. Of course, even in light mode, the background colour I had chosen made little difference and didn’t actually look better than the default or anything. It was just a case of me “adjusting things” and then thinking I was a genius because I had done _something_.

Anyway it’s nice that dark mode broke it because then I had to choose to either pick a colour to use for dark mode or just remove the `background-color` part. In my head it went from “picking a colour” to “what I’m in the business of maintaining multiple colour schemes now?” and that made it really easy to choose to remove stuff. Which is often a good choice.

(It also broke the CodeMirror stuff I use in the lambda calculus posts. Worked around that with some JavaScript that makes it change theme when the user changes their preference for light/dark. But yeah, the CodeMirror thing is probably also a case of having tried too hard to make things look good. Would be nice to just use `textarea`s for that too. I haven’t found an obvious and obviously supported and recommended way to programmatically insert text in a `textarea` that plays nice with its undo history. That’s probably all that’s stopping me.)
