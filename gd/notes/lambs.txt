# Some lambda-notes

Bla blah. This is a collection of notes with lambda calculus stuff. The posts tend to come with a kind of live lambda calculus environment where we can run examples or play around.

The ones called “How/What do the lambdas?” are more introductiony than the others, with stuff about syntax and semantics and how the editors work and such.
