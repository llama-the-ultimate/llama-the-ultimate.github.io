# Nothing is resolved
:blurb Nothing much happens.

From Adaptation:
> Sir, what if a writer is attempting to create a story where nothing much happens, where people don't change, they don't have any epiphanies. They struggle and are frustrated and nothing is resolved.

I donâ€™t know sometimes I think that something along those lines should maybe be a disclaimer for most of the posts here.
