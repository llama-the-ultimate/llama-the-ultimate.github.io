# Types of functions
:blurb Functions are sometimes a useful way to think about things.

Blah. So functions are fun and for me they are often a useful way to think about programs.

And then, for me, types more or less come with the territory. A function applied to an argument can be evaluated to a result value. When I think about a function, I tend to think about things like:

* What do arguments I can apply this to look like?
* Which expressions are likely to evaluate to things I can use as arguments?
* What will results I get from applying the function look like?
* Where can I use such results?

And that is like, type stuff, far as I can tell.

(Which is not to say that the thinking is necessarily in terms of a type _system_, or that any of this has a thing to do with type _checking_, or anything. Just, types, okay yes.)
