=> gd sokoboko-gfx In previous post we drew a level.

+++ Mostly the code from last time.
``` js prelude
const canvas = outElement.appendChild(document.createElement("canvas"));
const scale = 3;
const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

let level;
let moveList;

const moveListP = outElement.appendChild(document.createElement("p"));

const setLevel = (str) => {
  level = str.split("\n").map((x) => x.split(""));
  if (level[0].every((x) => x === " ")) {
    level.shift();
  }
  if (level[level.length - 1].every((x) => x === " ")) {
    level.pop();
  }
  moveList = "";
  canvas.width = level[0].length * 16 * scale;
  canvas.height = level.length * 16 * scale;
  ctx.imageSmoothingEnabled = false;
  drawLevel();
};
const level1 = `
#########
#  $ @..#
# $ $   #
#  ###  #
# $     #
##  ##..#
#########
`;

const spriteSheet = document.createElement("img");
spriteSheet.src = "./../assets/soko-sprites.png"
spriteSheet.alt = "sprite sheet";

const vector = (x, y) => ({ x: x, y: y });

const sprites = {
  " ": vector(0, 0), // top left is empty floor
  "#": vector(1, 0), // top right is wall
  "@": vector(0, 1), // middle left is player
  "+": vector(0, 1), // same sprite for player on goal square
  "$": vector(1, 1), // middle right is “box”
  ".": vector(0, 2), // bottom left is goal square
  "*": vector(1, 2), // middle left is “bosdx” on a goal square
};

const drawSquare = (square, position) => {
  const sprite = sprites[square];
  ctx.drawImage(
    spriteSheet,
    sprite.x * 16,
    sprite.y * 16,
    16,
    16,
    position.x * 16 * scale,
    position.y * 16 * scale,
    16 * scale,
    16 * scale
  );
};

const drawLevel = () => {
  level.forEach((row, y) => row.forEach((square, x) => drawSquare(square, vector(x, y))));
  moveListP.innerText = moveList;
};

spriteSheet.onload = () => setLevel(level1);
```

## Some vectors

We want to move the cat. We can make a function that returns its position, so that we know where to move it from. (Cats tend to move from where they are.)

``` js
const playerPosition = () => {
  for ([y, row] of level.entries()) {
    for ([x, square] of row.entries()) {
      if (square === "@" || square === "+") {
        return vector(x, y);
      }
    }
  }
};

console.log(playerPosition());
```

=> url http://www.sokobano.de/wiki/index.php?title=Level_format#Solution A Sokoban solution is like a string where each character corresponds to one move made.

We will make vectors for the directions the cat can move in, and a plus-function that we can use for adding a direction to a position. We’ll use the (lowercase) letters that are used in Sokoban solutions as property names.

``` js
const directions = {
  u: vector(0, -1),
  d: vector(0, 1),
  l: vector(-1, 0),
  r: vector(1, 0),  
};

const plus = (a, b) => vector(a.x + b.x, a.y + b.y);

console.log(plus(playerPosition(), directions.l));
```

Should be the position of the square to the left of the cat.

## Stupid is fun

Okay the array with the arrays with the characters is not a _great_ way to model things, but I like using the symbols from the level format. Like this is fun:
``` js
console.log(level.map(x => x.join("")).join("\n"));
```
But it _is_ awkward having more than one symbol for one thing (it’s the player if it’s a `@` _or_ a `+`, and so on). Something that takes different “collision layers” or something into account probably makes it easier to implement some things.

=> url https://www.puzzlescript.net/ PuzzleScript is cool btw.

Also, instead of one move being a functional update of the game state or something like that, we’ll just mutate the arrays. I dunno I just think the side-effecty way to do the movement is somehow neat. And it’s fun to kind of recklessly mutate state and then trust that we can implement undo-functionality in order to restore the state we destroyed :)

## Moving one thing

``` js
const levelGet = (position) => level[position.y][position.x];
const levelSet = (position, value) => level[position.y][position.x] = value;

const player = ["@", "+"];
const box = ["$", "*"];
const floor = [" ", "."];

const move = (thing, from, direction) => {
  const fromIdx = thing.indexOf(levelGet(from));
  if (fromIdx < 0) {
    return false;
  }
  const to = plus(from, direction);
  const toIdx = floor.indexOf(levelGet(to));
  if (toIdx < 0) {
    return false;
  }
  levelSet(from, floor[fromIdx]);
  levelSet(to, thing[toIdx]);
  return true;
};

console.log(move(box, vector(3, 1), directions.l));
console.log(move(player, playerPosition(), directions.l));
console.log(move(player, playerPosition(), directions.l));
console.log(move(player, playerPosition(), directions.l));
drawLevel();
```

So I think is at least mildly stupid-clever, what with the arrays and the indexes, but kind of fun. We use `indexOf` to check if the `from`-square is the expected `thing` (player or box), and to check that the `to`-square is floor. `indexOf` also finds out if a square has a goal on it:

* If `fromIdx` is `0` the `to`-square has the expected `thing` and its on empty floor.
* If it is `1` the square has the expected `thing` on a goal square.
* If it is less than `0` the expected `thing` is not on the square and we can’t make the move.

Same with `toIdx` but for floor: `0` is empty floor, `1` is goal square with nothing on it. Less than `0` means it’s blocked (wall or a floor/goal square with something on it).

And then we use those indexes to choose the correct characters for the two squares when making the moves. If the `to`-square was a goal square then we choose the “on goal” character from `thing`, and so on.

## Pushing a box

Anyway: We attempted to move things four times. First the box near the top one move to the left. Then the player to the left, three times. The last player-move didn’t go through since the `to`-square was blocked by the box. When moving the player we want to attempt to move any box on the `to`-square first, in the same direction. Then we can add the move to the move list by checking which moves went through:
* If the player didn’t move, no move was made.
* If the player moved and a box was moved we add the direction letter in uppercase.
* If the player moved and no box was moved we add the direction letter in lowercase.
* It can’t be the case that a box was moved and the player did not move. If a box was moved that must have made room for the player to make its move too.

``` js

const movePlayer = (directionLetter) => () => {
  const direction = directions[directionLetter];
  const position = playerPosition();
  const movedBox = move(box, plus(position, direction), direction);
  const movedPlayer = move(player, position, direction);
  if (!movedPlayer) {
    return false;
  }
  moveList += movedBox ? directionLetter.toUpperCase() : directionLetter;
  return true;
};

console.log(movePlayer("l")());
console.log(movePlayer("d")());
console.log(movePlayer("l")());
console.log(movePlayer("l")());
drawLevel();
```

The movelist says `LDl`: We pushed a box to the left, then pushed a box down, then moved to the left. (Then tried to move to the left again. But wall.)

## Controls

That’s pretty much it for movement. If we make so we can push some buttons to call the `movePlayer` function things will be pretty gamelike:

``` js
const commands = new Map([
  ["w", movePlayer("u")],
  ["a", movePlayer("l")],
  ["s", movePlayer("d")],
  ["d", movePlayer("r")]
]);

const doCommand = (key) => {
  if (commands.has(key)) {
    commands.get(key)();
    drawLevel();
  }
};
canvas.tabIndex = 0;
canvas.onkeydown = event => doCommand(event.key.toLowerCase());

const button = (key) => {
  const element= outElement.appendChild(document.createElement("button"));
  element.innerText = key;
  element.style.fontSize = "2rem";
  element.style.width = "3rem";
  element.onclick = () => doCommand(key);
};

const space = outElement.appendChild(document.createElement("div"));
space.style.float = "left";
space.style.height = "1px";
space.style.width = "3rem";
button("w");
outElement.appendChild(document.createElement("br"));
"asd".split("").forEach(button);
```

The `tabIndex` thing makes it so that the canvas can have focus and send `keydown` events. So you should be able to click the level and then move the cat with wasd. Also buttons. Maybe you can click on them if you don’t have a keyboard.

Can restart with `setLevel`:

``` js
setLevel(level1);
```

Okay that’s it for now. Boop.
